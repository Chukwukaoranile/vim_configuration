## Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use branches and pull requests on GitHub using the command line interface:
1.	Clone the repository:
•	Open your command line interface and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
•	Type git clone <repository-url> and press enter.
2.	Create a new branch:
•	Type git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature and press enter. This will create a new branch named "feature/my-new-feature" and switch to it.
3.	Make changes to the new branch:
•	Make your changes to the code using your preferred code editor.
4.	Stage and commit your changes:
•	Type git add . and press enter to stage all changes.
•	Type git commit -m "Add new feature" and press enter to commit the changes with a commit message.
5.	Push your changes to GitHub:
•	Type git push origin feature/my-new-feature and press enter. This will push the changes to the new branch on GitHub.
6.	Open a pull request:
•	Go to the repository's page on GitHub and click on the "Pull requests" tab.
•	Click on the green "New pull request" button.
•	Select the branch you just pushed your changes to as the "base" branch.
•	Select the branch you made changes on as the "compare" branch.
•	Review the changes in the pull request and make sure everything looks good.
•	Click the "Create pull request" button.
7.	Review and merge the pull request:
•	Review the changes in the pull request and leave comments if necessary.
•	Once the changes have been approved, click on the "Merge pull request" button.
•	Add a merge message and confirm the merge.
8.	Delete the old branch:
•	After the merge is complete, type git checkout main and press enter to switch to the main branch.
•	Type git branch -d feature/my-new-feature and press enter to delete the old branch.

## And that's it! Using branches and pull requests on GitHub using the command line interface can help you and your team work more efficiently and collaboratively on code.
